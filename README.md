<h1>What is the aim of this project</h1>

This Blog project aims to sharpen my python, HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
By working on this project, I managaed to reinforced my understanding of the following 

1. Python Models
   a. Models is eseentially a database where all the information needed to run the web application works
   is kept. 
   b. Models are created with the class objects.

2. Class Based Views
   a. Class Based Voews is another approach used to execute functions instead of
      using function based views.

3. Forms. py
   This is an extremely usedful component to create forms within th 
   
4. URL Patterns
   A URL path is written in the follwing manner so that when the URL is typed,
   the path is recognized and correlates with the function ot the class based views
   ---re_path(r'^$',views.PostListView.as_view(),name='post_list')-- which then executes the class based 
   view function which eventally renders a HTML template
